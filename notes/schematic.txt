Policy when loading schematics.

If the user session is valid:
  if there is a schematic id in the url:
    if it's valid, use it
    if      it's invalid, use cookie recentSchematicId
    else if there's a valid schematic in the 'projectrecent' table, use it
    else if there's a valid schematic in the portfolio, use the first
    else create a new one and use it

  else if the cookie recentSchematicId is valid, use it
  else if there's a valid schematic in the 'projectrecent' table, use it
  else if there is a valid schematic in the portfolio, use the first
  else create a new one and use it

else (user session is invalid or non existent):
  create an anonymous user with a new schematic and project (and session)


Normal usage should be: click on a schemaatic link, see it in the url, use it
as normal if you're logged in.  User session is persistent until browser quit.

If you're not logged in and just browsing, then you'll be given an anonymous
account to play around with.  Anonymous user session is persistent for a year.

In the corner cases where you're trying to access the schematic editor without
valid information, it takes a 'best effort' approach of trying to load the
schematic that seemed most natural to me.  This is bound to produce some
unexpected behavior, so maybe it's better to just give an error and let the
user know.
