  Suggestions:
  1) show your latest, most complex circuits you can handle here for the "try it"
     samples... and put snapshots of these on landing page.

  2) rearrange the page a bit, because if you have a small screen, you don't even
     see the "try it" stuff at the bottom
     (possibly by making the Register stuff a little smaller, or something)

  ~~definitely fix the auto centering thing when you start editing~~

  anonymous users should still be dumped into the landing page.
  The anony landing page should have a link to 'projects' where they
  can further do stuff logged in anonymously.

  ~~Portfolio "Portfolio" tab -> "Projects" tab~~
  ~~project names should not include the username (for your own projects)~~
