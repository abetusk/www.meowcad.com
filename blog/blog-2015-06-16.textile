Hi there!  This is "MeowCAD":https://meowcad.com!

MeowCAD is an online, in-browser electronics design tool that's completely free and open source.  Use it to create schematics, printed circuit boards, share with your friends or just play around.

Though MeowCAD has been live for almost 2 years it's only recently that MeowCAD has reached a minimum level of functionality to be considered usable.  There are rough corners to be sure but it's in a state where we can use it ourselves to create a schematic, create a printed circuit board, export Gerbers, send it off to be fabbed and get back a functioning PCB.

The board above was fabbed through "OSH Park":https://oshpark.com/.  You can check out both the "schematic":https://meowcad.com/view_sch?project=1bd24ce3-91d9-4846-b30d-1a8cfacd72d0 and the "board":https://meowcad.com/view_pcb?project=1bd24ce3-91d9-4846-b30d-1a8cfacd72d0 right here on MeowCAD.

In another post we'll go more in depth about the process of submitting to a board manufacturer but in this post we wanted to start things off with a little description of ourselves.

Here's a screencast (it's about 17m) of some functionality:

Feedback is always welcome, either through the "feedback form":/feedback or through the "issue tracker":https://github.com/abetusk/www.meowcad.com/issues.  We'd love to hear from you, positive, negative, rant, rave, whatever.  

Have fun and happy hacking!
